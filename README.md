# TODO App

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

Todo App is a test application that brings together several of the technologies of my preference to create a mini boilerplate and carry out work on it.

This is only the backend version, when I have the frontend version ready I will put a link here.

The technologies are

- Nestjs + Typescript
- Swagger
- JWT
- Postgres
- Prisma
- Docker

## Features

- TODOS Controller
- User Controller

## Installation

TODOS App requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14.7.1+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd Project-Directoru
yarn install
yarn start:dev
```
